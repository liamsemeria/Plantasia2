control flow:
how to bring multiple lines into a branch?
lines to the right can be brought in
|  |
?[ |
|<*|
]

maybe can bring anything down
no instructions between the brackets execute if false
prints 5,4,3,2,1

|  |<<5
|  |   |<<1
|  :[  |
|  |   |
|  |   |#>|
|  |   |<<|
|  |<_-|
|  ]
|  .
probably will need to do something for else (like wither and dead)
otherwise, there would be no way to do else besides making a copy of the compared value

what happens when a stack gets killed during a branch? need a way to determine the lifespan of stacks
if left untouched, the it could be hard to track what stacks are alive based on the ast. killing a stack during a loop would be bad.

custom error type: what phase it was, what line the error is, what error it is


PLANTASIA TO LLVM IR 
map stacks to kind of virtual registers

problems with mapping:
    propagation, values getting deleted during an operation

make "shitty" normal IR that gets optimized through copy propagation
    by turning props and pops into moves, the stacks no longer need to exist and it just looks like suboptimal IR

pop 5, b0
pop 1, c0
br b0, loop, loop_end
loop:
    prop c0, d0
    pop d0, c1
    sub c1, b0
    br b0, loop, loop_end
loop_end:
    ret b0
